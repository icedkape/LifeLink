        <p>
          Consent documents play a vital role in ensuring that individuals fully understand and agree to the medical actions being taken on their behalf. By clearly outlining procedures, risks, and responsibilities, consent documents protect patients from unexpected outcomes and ensure that their rights are respected at every step.
        </p>
        <p>
          Properly reviewed consent documents also promote transparency and trust between patients and healthcare providers. They confirm that decisions are made voluntarily and with complete information, helping prevent misunderstandings, legal issues, and ethical concerns—especially in critical or sensitive situations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond compliance, consent documents serve as a foundation for ethical and patient-centered care. They empower individuals to take part in their own healthcare decisions while ensuring that medical institutions follow professional and legal standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s why at LifeLink, it’s important that you know your consent documents are clear, verified, and handled with care—so your choices are respected and your rights are always protected.
