          After you submit your information, all files and medical details go through a careful review process to ensure accuracy, completeness, and eligibility. This step is essential in making sure that every potential match is valid, safe, and aligned with medical standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the review is completed, LifeLink begins the alert matching process. Our system checks your verified information against available and compatible cases, ensuring that matches are based on precise medical criteria and ethical guidelines.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a potential match is identified, you will not be contacted immediately. Instead, LifeLink ensures that all necessary confirmations are in place before moving forward, protecting your privacy and avoiding false or premature alerts.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s why at LifeLink, it’s important that you know—you will receive an email notification only after your files have been thoroughly reviewed and a valid alert match has been confirmed.
